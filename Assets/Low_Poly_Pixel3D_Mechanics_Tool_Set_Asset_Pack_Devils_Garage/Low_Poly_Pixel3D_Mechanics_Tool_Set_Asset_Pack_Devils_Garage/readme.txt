Thinking about building that minecraft-isque mechanic game? Look no further with the Low Poly 3D Mechanic's Toolset Asset Pack

This Lowpoly Pixel 3D asset pack contains a whole bunch of tools. Each asset is cleanly modeled, textured, unwrapped, and UV mapped. The texture contains some pixel art that makes it look unique! Some assets are separated so that you can build your own combination like a double, double burger, etc.  The mesh and texture are very small and can be used in a mechanic game.
